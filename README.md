# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System

* **01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance** :

  A safety plan provides an overall framework for a functional safety project.
  it contains :Purpose of the Safety Plan , Goals and Measures, Development Interface Agreement, and more...

* **02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment**
    
    There are five steps to the hazard analysis and risk assessment : 
    *  Conduct a situational analysis
    *  Identify malfunctions
    *  Combine situations and malfunctions and assess risk
    *  Determine ASILs
    * Derive safety goals

* **03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance**
    
    Helps define more depth of these info :

    *  functional safety requirements and their attributes (ASIL, Fault Tolerant Time Interval, Safe State, Verification and Validation Acceptance Criteria)
    *  system diagram with an updated architecture (we will provide this for you)
    *  warning and degradation concept, which explains the warnings that the driver will receive as well as how the system will be shut down when a malfunction occurs.

* **04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance**

    We will go more in depth than Functional Safety Concept document, with more focus on software and hardware development, we are now diving deep into the V model

* **05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance**

    software requirements are much more specific than technical requirements. Software requirements specify variable names, signal paths, and software protocols and mechanisms. A software engineer should be able to write a program from the software requirements and software architecture.
